docker-htpc
===========

Containers for HTPC apps.

All containers are built from the `ubuntu:trusty` base image because they all
have official .deb distributions for ubuntu.

```
WARNING: This is a work in progress and suits my own specific needs. Feel free
to use pieces of it but I wouldn't recommend using it wholesale unless your
HTPC server setup is magically identical to mine.
```

init
----

All containers use [s6-overlay](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay)
for process supervision and pre-startup scripts to fix permissions on the
/config volumes.

user
----

The apps inside the containers each run as the `nobody` user for security.
Permission dropping is handled by s6-overlay. Also, s6-overlay will run
`chown -R nobody /config` inside each container during startup to fix up the
perms in the /config volumes.

Volumes
-------

Each container follows a similar pattern for config and data volumes:

- `/files` -> `/files`: Large data volume. In my case, there are folders such
  as: `/files/tv_shows`, `/files/movies`, `/files/downloads`, etc.

- `/etc/<container_name>` -> `/config`: eg: `/etc/sabnzbd/` on the host is
   mapped to `/config` inside the sabnzbd
   container for persistent config storage.

Ports
-----

- `sabzbd`: http web ui on 8085
- `sonarr`: http web ui on 8989
- `deluge`: web UI on 8083. Note: the deluge container is run with `--net=host`
            in order to allow deluge to punch holes with NAT-PMP. It will work
            fine without `--net=host` however, perhaps with limited
            connectivity to some torrent peers.
- `plex`: 32400. Note this container is run with `--net=host`.
- `plexpy`: http web ui on 8181
- `couchpotato`: http web ui on 5050
- `timecapsule`: Uses docker network driver such as MacVLAN so that the container
-                is able to obtain its own IP address on the LAN.
                 See [timecapsule (Samba)](#timecapsule-samba) for more details.
- `muximux`: http web ui on port 8000

Note: most of these apps can also expose TLS https ports but the current config
      does not expose these.

Usage
-----

### List tasks and descriptions

    $ make help

    build_all                      build all containers
    build_deluge                   build the deluge container
    build_sabnzbd                  build the sabnzbd container
    build_sonarr                   build the sonarr container
    create_all                     create and start all containers
    create_deluge                  create and start the deluge container
    create_sabnzbd                 create and start the sabnzbd container
    create_sonarr                  create and start the sonarr container
    help                           print list of tasks and descriptions
    remove_all                     remove all containers
    restart_all                    restart all containers
    stop_all                       stop all containers

### Build containers

    $ make build_all

### Create and start containers

    $ make create_all

Containers will be created, started, and set with `--restart=always` flag.

### Update all containers

    $ make stop_all
    $ make remove_all
    $ make build_all
    $ make create_all

This will rebuild each container, pulling down latest code for reach. Most
containers are built from .deb pkgs so this will depend on the upstream project
releasing a new .deb for the latest version.

### Update individual container

Stop the existing container, delete it, build a new one, create it:

    $ docker stop sabnzbd
    $ docker rm   sabnzbd
    $ make build_sabnzbd
    $ make create_sabnzbd

@TODO: make a single task for updating/re-creating an individual container..

### Start/Stop/Restart individual containers

No make tasks for these since they're simple docker commands:

    $ docker ps
    $ docker stop sabnzbd
    $ docker start sabnzbd
    $ docker restart sabnzbd

### View container logs

Use `docker logs` command:

    $ docker logs sonarr
    $ docker logs -f sonarr

Notes
-----

### deluge autoconnect

Sonarr will not be able to connect to deluge unless you login to the deluge-web
client and select the server. This needs to be done once per startup of the
deluge container, unless auto-connect is enabled. Follow these directions
to setup deluge-web auto-connect: http://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/Faq#HowdoIauto-connecttoaspecificdaemon

### timecapsule (Samba)

This container expects to connect to a docker network named `localnet`. This
network should be created with the macvlan or ipvlan drivers available in
docker 1.12+. This allows the container to be started and acquire its own
IP on your local network in order to run Bonjour (avahi) services to announce
itself on the network.

This is particular to my setup because I have an existing
samba instance running on the host providing general file sharing services. This
container acts as a separate device that looks roughly like a timecapsule on
the network exporting only a single `timemachine` mount.

It is probably possible to use standard Docker port mapping instead. See the
udp and tcp ports exposed in `timecapsule/Dockerfile`. However, getting the
avahi announcement to work could be challenging. A workaround would be to
publish the timecapsule services from the host's avahi using the
`timecapsule/smb.service` file.

If your local network is 192.168.0.0/24 you can create a `localnet` network
with the following docker command:

    $ docker network create -d macvlan \
        --subnet 192.168.0.0/24 \
        --gateway 192.168.0.1
        -o parent=eth0 \
        localnet

TimeMachine will attempt to use the entire disk by default. We constrain it
by lying about the max available space on the samba share. This is done using
a `dfree` script. By default, the max space presented to TimeMachine is 750GB.
This can be changed by updating the `TIMEMACHINE_MAX_VOL_SIZE_GB` environment
variable in the Dockerfile.
